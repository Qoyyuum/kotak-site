# Frequently Asked Questions

## Why build Kotak?

Currently, there is no other way to build or own your e-commerce site for free and to start taking customer orders for pick up and/or delivery, without thinking too much on using a payment gateway.

## How much is it to use Kotak service?

It is free for all to use.

## Why not let MSMEs use Facebook Marketplace or Instagram to promote their products?

Kotak service doesn't limit them from using social media to reach out to more customers. This service helps them centralize all of their products into one site for each seller (think of Shopify) that they can own with their branding and add extra offers to it (like coupons and discounts).

But this does help the sellers to avoid their products being flooded on social media.

## Why not use Shopify?

Very costly to pay USD20 or so for a shopping site that doesn't allow or provide a way for Bruneians to collect online payments. The closest that Shopify can offer is to have Bruneians sign up for a crypto wallet service to collect payment like BitPay or Coinbase or something. And if Bruneians don't know how to withdraw those collected payments in their crypto wallets, it's stuck.

## Why not use Wordpress and WooCommerce or other installable shopping/e-commerce solutions?

Those solutions require at least 2 things:

1. A domain name for customers to navigate to (e.g. www.syarikatalidananak2.com)
2. A web hosting provider to hold all of the web scripts, media files and database or a server to manage that costs monthly.

While they are inexpensive to run (average BND20 per month) at its basic level, it doesn't cover for online payment. This means that they would need to set up a payment gateway like [Stripe Atlas](https://stripe.com/atlas) or other services. And it requires a hefty deposit fee or some other subscription fee, and have not considered paying taxes yet and the amount of effort to setting it up to make it worthwhile doing.

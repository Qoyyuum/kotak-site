# Frequently Asked Questions

## Why build Kotak?

Currently, there is no other way to build or own your e-commerce site for free and to start taking customer orders for pick up and/or delivery, without thinking too much on using a payment gateway.

## How much is it to use Kotak service?

It is free for all to use.

## Why not let MSMEs use Facebook Marketplace or Instagram to promote their products?

Kotak service doesn't limit them from using social media to reach out to more customers. This service helps them centralize all of their products into one site for each seller (think of Shopify) that they can own with their branding and add extra offers to it (like coupons and discounts).

But this does help their customers to avoid their products being flooded on social media.
